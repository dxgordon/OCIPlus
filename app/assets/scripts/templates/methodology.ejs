      <h2 id="oci-plus-input-data">OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview Input Data</h2>
      <p>The models that underpin the Oil Climate Index (OCI)<a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#methodology/footnote-1" class="same-page-nav footnote-inline"><sup>1</sup></a> require consistent, comparable, and verifiable open access data on oil and gas resources. This includes oil assays (analyses of predetermined data measuring a crude oil’s chemical and physical characteristics) that are reported out in a specified format, upstream field-level equipment and operating specifications, midstream refining process input requirements, and downstream transport and end-use data.</p>
      <p>In the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview, we present a sample of 29 diverse oil and gas resources. We went through an intensive process to obtain data on 75 sample oils and 35 sample gases, all of which will be included in the forthcoming full version of the OCI<sup>+</sup>. We used hundreds of academic sources, technical documents, and reports from industry news to identify data. In doing so, we compiled a list of alternate names for our resources, since many oil and gas fields are recorded using slightly different names by our wide range of sources. The list of OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview aliases can be found in <a href="assets/resources/appendex-a.docx">Appendix A</a>. Oil and gas resources were selected based on their geographic, geologic, chemical, and physical diversity. But the final arbiter of the global resources selected was data availability. There were resources that we would have selected save for the lack of transparent data. </p>
      <p><strong>OPGEE</strong> (the Oil Production Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimator) technically requires up to 50 data inputs, but the use of smart defaults allows the model to assign reasonable estimates based on just a few key characteristics. For upstream data inputs for the OCI's sample resources, including references and sources, see the workbook.</p>
      <p><strong>PRELIM</strong> (the Petroleum Refinery Life-Cycle Inventory Model) requires crude oil assays that use a specified number of temperature cuts. Assays provided in a different format (for example, too few temperature cuts or different temperature bands) must be adjusted using an openly available transformation tool—a process that can introduce errors into PRELIM. In the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview web tool, the assay sources for the sample oils are specified in the “oil details” pages. The assay data used in OCI calculations are available in the PRELIM model workbook on the “Assay Inventory” worksheet.</p>
      <p><strong>OPGEM</strong> (the Oil and Gas Products Emissions Module) data inputs require a detailed product slate (measured in barrels per day for liquid products, kilograms per day for solid products, or gas density for gaseous products), which are reported out in PRELIM. Petroleum coke, LPG, and petrochemical feedstock densities are used to convert solid and gaseous petroleum products to barrels. For density purposes, it is assumed that petrochemical feedstock is one-half ethane and one-half propane, while LPG is one-half propane and one-half butane. Barrels per day of product are then converted into barrels of product per BOE processed oil and gas by multiplying by the ratio of oil into the refinery by adjust refined volume at equilibrium and dividing by the total oil and gas volume processed in OPGEE. For GHGs from end use, the barrels of each product per BOE are multiplied by emission factors in the case of petroleum fuels and for petrochemical feedstock we use EPA reported estimated emissions to convert petrochemical feedstock to ethylene. For the GHGs from product transport, we divide products in to liquid light, liquid heavy, solid, and gas, and make assumptions that the user can change for the distance traveled and shipping mode. Shipping vehicle and fuel emissions factors are obtained from the Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation) Model. End-use emissions from the combustion of petroleum products are calculated using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emissions factors. </p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>Distance:</em> Given current limitations posed by the reporting of global petroleum product transport data, the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview assumes that lighter petroleum liquid products (petrochemical feedstocks, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, NGL, LPG) are transported via pipeline 2,414 kilometers or 1,500 miles (the equivalent distance from Houston to New York) and then by heavy-duty tanker truck 380 kilometers or 236 miles (the equivalent distance to either the Washington, DC or Boston metropolitan areas). Heavy liquid products (fuel Oil, residual fuels) are assumed to travel 1,200 km by rail, 1,200 km by tanker, and 500 miles by truck. Solid fuels (petroleum coke and sulfur, which is not currently included but should be in an OGPEM 2.0) are assumed to travel 3,352 km by tanker and 750 miles by rail. Gas is assumed to move via pipeline an estimated 2,414 km unless it is transported as LNG in a tanker in the case of Australia Gorgon or Qatar Idd El Shargi.</li>
        <li><em>Price:</em> Adding natural gas (compressed and LNG) along with NGLs and petrochemical feedstock makes it more difficult to ascertain product spot prices, which are not consistently available in an open-source format for many petroleum products. OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview eliminates the metric basis (per $ product and per $ crude oil) from the analysis. This may be added back for user assumptions in a future version.</li>

      <h3>Global Warming Potentials</h3>
        <p>Download the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2013 global warming potentials <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (page 714, Table 8.7). Note that the IPCC is discussing whether to increase the methane GWP in AR6. If this change is operationalized it would need to be updated in the forthcoming OCI<sup>+</sup>.</p>
        <p>OCI GHG emissions estimates are based on equivalent GHG emissions for carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, combining these into one result using different global warming potentials (GWPs) that compare the other GHGs to carbon dioxide. For the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview, we used data reported by the IPCC. The IPCC’s 2013 assessment report (AR5) states that the one-hundred-year GWP including climate-carbon feedback loops for carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is referenced at 1. The GWP for methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) is 34 times greater than CO<sub>2</sub>, and for nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), it is 298 times greater than CO<sub>2</sub>. To ensure that OPGEE and PRELIM are using these GWPs, check table 2.1 on the “Constants” sheet and select global warming potential values as 2013 IPCC AR5 on the “Main Input & Output” sheet, respectively.</p>
        <h3>Data Quality and Transparency</h3>
        <p>The degree of uncertainty in the GHG emissions estimates modeled through the OCI depends on the quality of the data. Data quality parameters were developed in OCI 2.0 using two kinds of parameters: crude assay and field-characterization methods on the one hand, and characterization of real-world operations on the other. Natural and technical variability, especially as these relate to changing operations over time, affect the quality of these OCI input data. In order to characterize the quality of data along these parameters, the OCI 2.0 gave each oil a data score depending on certain criteria for each stage of production, as described in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wpo6g2vatpoqglc/Draft%20OCI%20Data%20Quality%20Assessment%20V6.xlsx?dl=0" target="_blank">this Excel workbook</a>. Within three data quality elements—reliability and reproducibility, consistency and completeness, accuracy—inputs for each model were scored using the criteria summarized below. We anticipate expanding and updating the analysis of data quality in the full version of the OCI<sup>+</sup>.</p>

      <h2 id="oci-plus-modeling-methods">OCI<sup>+</sup> Modeling Methods</h2>
        <p>OPGEE and PRELIM are distinct models that are run separately. However, any oil present in wet gas processing is then input into PRELIM that usually necessitates the use of a proxy assay. The gas outputs from OPGEE and the oil outputs from PRELIM are product inputs into OGPEM. The resulting GHG outputs of the three models are then summed to calculate total GHG emissions. All outputs are converted into the same functional units before they are summed. The default unit is kilograms CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions per barrel of oil equivalent (of processed oil and gas). End product and co-product combustion is generally reported out in OGPEM, regardless of where in the supply chain it is generated (for example, net upstream petcoke from upgrading and midstream petcoke from deep conversion refining or processed gas that is handled upstream). However, if data exist, use of co-products in upstream processes is also taken into account; this is evident in the use of upstream petcoke in extra-heavy oil upgrading.</p>
        <p>Discrepancies and inconsistencies in OCI model inputs can occur because of different public data sources and lack of coordinated data collection. For example, discrepancies can arise in API gravity inputs into OPGEE and PRELIM. We use the assay gravity for both OPGEE and PRELIM inputs. The only exception is in the case of upgraded oil sands where the plotted gravity is that of raw bitumen (the input oil) rather than the synthetic crude oil that results after processing. The API gravity presented in the web tool is derived from the oil assays used in PRELIM, because this model’s emissions estimates are more sensitive to API gravity than OPGEE’s, where changes in API gravity generally do not make a material difference in upstream GHG results.</p>
        <p>When there is no directly corresponding assay for an OPGEE oil field or associated oil from a gas field, a proxy assay is selected that closely fits the sample oil’s characteristics. As actual assays are collected, proxy assays will be replaced. The current use of proxy assays in OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview are noted on the Oil Details pages for each oil and gas and discussed in Special Cases below.</p>
      <h3>OPGEE Version 3.0</h3>
        <p>Link to the model workbook hosted by Stanford University: <a href="https://pangea.stanford.edu/researchgroups/eao/research/opgee-oil-production-greenhouse-gas-emissions-estimator" target="_blank">https://pangea.stanford.edu/researchgroups/eao/research/opgee-oil-production-greenhouse-gas-emissions-estimator</a>.</p>
        <p>The field and resource data specified are used to generate OPGEE’s bulk assessment tool for each resource, which is then used to calculate base-run GHG emissions outputs for each oil and gas run.
        <p>OPGEE considers the transport of oil to the refinery inlet and gas to the distribution hub. In the preview tool, the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview continues to assume that all oil is transported from its country of origin to Houston via the mode that is nearest to the oil field. On the gas side, the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview assumes that compressed natural gas (CNG) is transported by pipeline from the field to a major city or hub within its region (i.e. North American gas is sent to Henry Hub). Liquefied natural gas (LNG) are special cases in the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview. In the OCI<sup>+</sup>, we will build out LNG transport and regasification and CNG shipment specifications. We do not expect this to have a material change in OGPEM’s estimated GHG emissions. A user designated option is planned to allow for special cases to be modeled for natural gas transport and end use options, which can vary widely.</p>
        <p>In the case of petcoke produced upstream during oil-sand and extra-heavy-oil upgrading, a separate calculation in OPGEE is used to estimate the net petcoke produced. This considers the OPGEE-derived portion of petcoke used as an upstream energy source and subtracts that from the total petcoke production reported by the <a href="https://www.aer.ca/documents/sts/ST39.pdf" target="_blank">Alberta Energy Regulator</a>. Lacking detailed reporting in Venezuela, OPGEE uses the average relative amounts of petcoke production reported for Canadian oil sands for Venezuelan extra-heavy-oil upgrading.</p>
        <p>The OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview web tool has several upstream oil and gas field operating parameters that users can modify. These adjustments reflect variations to OPGEE inputs that have been pre-loaded as static model runs. In the future completed OCI<sup>+</sup> web tool, user adjustments will change OPGEE 3.0 inputs and generate live, new model runs.  Reductions and increases are calculated off a 100 percent base, unless otherwise specified, for the flaring emissions intensity, venting emissions intensity, fugitive emissions intensity, and the emissions intensity of steam (simulating solar-powered steam generation). Users can adjust these operating assumptions on the Supply Chain and Analysis web tool pages. On these pages, users can also adjust the percent of natural gas and associated gas liquefied as LNG. Most resources default to zero percent LNG (two exceptions: Australia Gorgon defaults to 100 percent; Qatar Idd El Shargi defaults to 50 percent). Runs that model increases of 50 and 100 percent of gas liquefied and shipped as LNG are available for the following resources: Nigeria Obagi, Australia Cossack, Azerbaijan Azeri, US Texas Spraberry, US Eagle Ford all zones, UAE Shah, New Zealand Kapuni, China Sulige, and Iran South Pars. </p>
        <p>Under California regulations, OPGEE reports GHG-emissions outputs in units of kilogram CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per megajoule of petroleum products generated. These outputs are converted into emissions per barrel of oil equivalent by multiplying them by the weighted lower heating value of all processed oil and gas products (in megajoule per barrel of oil equivalent).</p>
      <h4>OPGEE Flaring Emissions Estimation and Mapping Boundaries in the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview Web Tool</h4>
        <p>Flaring emissions were estimated by aligning satellite measurements of flares with outlines of the oil fields. The flares and volumes were identified with data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor, which, when combined with the Nightfire Algorithm, can detect and provide estimates to quantify flare location and volume<a id="footnote-ref-2" href="#methodology/footnote-2" class="same-page-nav footnote-inline"><sup>2</sup></a>. The Nightfire Algorithm, developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), develops annual estimates for flaring volumes and aggregates the data into a spatial database that designates the type of flare as production, refining, or processing. The flaring rates reflect 2017 upstream flaring volumes located within the oil fields.</p>
        <p>In order to determine which flares should be included, the geographic extent of each field was determined. The location and areal extent for each field was collected from publicly available data where available. Location data were also aggregated from the Petroleum Economist’s <em>World Energy Atlas</em><a id="footnote-ref-3" href="#methodology/footnote-3" class="same-page-nav footnote-inline"><sup>3</sup></a>. The Atlas provides maps of oil fields across the world, as well as a number of oil-associated infrastructure projects (for example, pipelines and loading terminals). Each available image (regardless of source) was overlaid with satellite imagery from Google Earth before oil field boundaries were generated. These boundaries were drawn liberally to ensure that all visible surface infrastructure is included within the flaring estimation boundary. In many cases, the final boundary including surface infrastructure is larger than the field boundaries reported in public maps or the <em>World Energy Atlas</em>. For offshore fields, boundaries are placed to focus on production and processing platforms, where visible from Google Earth imagery.</p>
        <p>Within each field boundary, flared volumes were summed to determine total flaring emissions from the field. Not all oil fields contained satellite flare data. Many offshore fields use floating production storage and offloading (FPSOs) vessels that navigate the waters around the field. FPSOs are responsible for flaring associated with offshore fields. For offshore fields that did not contain flares (in the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview these were Australia Cossack, Australia Gorgon, and Mexico Chuc) flares in a close radius of the fields were selected.</p>
        <p>For four onshore fields (U.S. California Midway Sunset, U.S. California South Belridge, UAE Shah, and New Zealand Kapuni), flares proximal to the field boundaries were selected. The <em>World Energy Atlas</em> was used to confirm that these flares could not be attributed to any other nearby fields. It was confirmed that these flaring values were comparable to the 2014 flare data used in OCI Phase 2. This method provides more accurate flaring rate estimates than assuming a default flaring rate for these fields.</p>
        <h4>OPGEE Venting Emissions Estimation</h4>
          <p>The OCI up through Phase 2 was concerned with the production of oil resources and their associated emissions, primarily carbon dioxide. However, a global increase in natural gas production ushered in a heightened importance of properly estimating venting and fugitive methane emissions. During the preparation of OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview, the OPGEE model was not as optimized to estimate venting methane emissions as it was for fugitive methane. The International Energy Agency (IEA) provides the best currently available estimates. See Tables 9 and 10 <a href="https://www.iea.org/media/weowebsite/2017/WEM_Documentation_WEO2017.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. IEA splits out vented methane emissions for both onshore and offshore production sites. All emission values are based on the United States and can be scaled to estimate global emissions using a country multiplier. OPGEE results are the default for methane venting; however, when the venting webtool slider is in use, OPGEE venting values are subtracted out and replaced with IEA values.</p>
      <h3>PRELIM Version 1.3</h3>
        <p>Link to the model workbook hosted by the University of Calgary: <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/lcaost/PRELIM">http://www.ucalgary.ca/lcaost/PRELIM</a>. </p>
        <p>PRELIM version 1.3 contains 149 oil assays in its inventory. These assays are run through the “Results All Assays” macro three times (see the workbook for this macro). Each PRELIM run corresponds to a different refinery
            configuration—hydroskimming, medium conversion, and deep conversion (the last two with fluid catalytic cracking and gas-oil hydrocracking units). These three runs are then repeated with PRELIM’s methane-only switch turned on, in order to isolate
            methane emissions for each oil through each refinery configuration.</p>
        <p>The default refinery is chosen by PRELIM using an API gravity and sulfur-content categorization scheme, as summarized below. Users can run oils through different refinery configurations in the OCI web tool to estimate how GHG emissions change.
            However, this option is not included in the OCI<sup>+ </sup>Preview web tool. Go to PRELIM to employ this detailed analysis of non-default refinery runs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deep conversion refinery—heavy crude (15 to 22 API) with any sulfur level</li>
            <li>Medium conversion refinery—medium sweet crude (22 to 32 API, with less than 0.5 percent sulfur content by weight); medium sour crude (22 to 32 API, with more than 0.5 percent sulfur content by weight); and light sour crude (over 32 API, with
                more than 0.5 percent sulfur content by weight)</li>
            <li>Hydroskimming refinery—light sweet crude (over 32 API, with less than 0.5 percent sulfur content by weight)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>The exceptions among our sample oils are discussed in the “Special Cases” section below.</em></p>
        <p>PRELIM version 1.3 by default uses a float case, allowing product volumes to be determined by the optimal use of refinery process units for processing individual, unblended oils. This version of PRELIM also allows users to specify output ratios
            for products like gas, diesel, and jet fuel, among others, in the “Expert Input” sheet. In order to use this tool, the following add-ins must be selected for use: Analysis ToolPak, Analysis ToolPak - VBA, and Solver Add-In.</p>
        <p>Co-products, including petrochemical feedstock, asphalt, and petcoke, can be turned on and off by users. A crude blending tool was added in PRELIM version 1.1 and was further expanded in Phase 3. Additionally, a hydrogen surplus that results from
            lighter oils is noted but not credited for these oils or debited to heavier oils in PRELIM version 1.1.</p>
        <p>The OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview runs PRELIM 1.3 was run with petrochemical feedstock “on” and also reports out liquid petroleum gas (LPG) outputs. Petrochemicals (assumed to be 50/50 ethane and propane) and LPG (assumed to be 50/50 propane and
            butane) are reported out in their gaseous state. In order to convert this to an equivalent in liquid barrels per day for use in OGPEM, we obtain a conversion factor by dividing the liquid density of the two products by their gas density. Dividing
            this conversion factor into PRELIM outputs in barrels per day delivers the result for these gaseous petrochemical products. Other model assumptions are provided in the <a
              href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/lcaost/files/lcaost/prelim-v1.3-documentation.pdf">PRELIM User Guide and Technical Documentation (PDF</a>).</p>
      <h3>OPGEM Version 1.0</h3>
        <p>The OPEM model workbook that was developed for OCI 2.0 can be found in the “OPEM 2.0 Runs” sheet of the main workbook. We are currently converting OPEM to OGPEM to include gas co-products from oil and gas production.</p>
        <p>An overriding goal of OGPEM is to include final liquid, gas, and solid petroleum product use in the default GHG emissions calculation—and thereby avoid carbon leakage from—all petroleum products and co-products. Historically, petroleum end use has
            centered on transport fuels, including gasoline and diesel, and has ignored or incompletely and inconsistently reported GHG emissions from petroleum co-products like petcoke, fuel oil, residual fuels, asphalt, and petrochemical feedstocks. OGPEM
            version 1.0 includes these co-products; those that are not yet displayed in the web tool (e.g., asphalt, sulfur) will be added to a revised OCI<sup>+</sup> webtool. </p>
        <p>The default product slate output from PRELIM can be found in the worksheet “PRELIM Product Slates” in the OGPEM workbook. Alternative product slates can be generated by running the PRELIM model.</p>
        <p>Petcoke production (both in production-heavy oil upgrading in OPGEE and refining in PRELIM) defaults to 100 percent combustion and can be adjusted down to 50 percent and zero in the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview web tool. For the OCI<sup>+</sup>
            Preview, asphalt was run “off” and petrochemical feedstock was run “on.” Additionally, for the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview, we assume all NGL is used as petrochemical feedstock. </p>
        <p>OGPEM uses emissions factors reported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for GHG inventories, updated in November 2015. These emissions factors are documented <a
              href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/documents/emission-factors_nov_2015.pdf">here</a>. Note that the EPA assumes near-complete fuel combustion in the calculation of published emissions factors. Depending on the quality of
            the engine in which a fuel is burned, EPA emissions factors may result in a best-case (lowest emissions) estimate. This will be investigated in the OCI<sup>+</sup>. Although emission factors have not changed in a material way, EPA emission
            factors for fuel combustion have been updated <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-03/documents/emission-factors_mar_2018_0.pdf">here</a>. These will be incorporated into the next phase of the OCI<sup>+</sup>. However, EPA has
            not updated its GWP to AR5. The OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview uses AR5 GWPs; this is discussed above under Global Warming Potential.</p>

      <h3>Converting Emissions Outputs to Other Metrics</h3>
      <p>The default functional unit or metric in the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview web tool is GHG emissions per barrel of oil equivalent of processed oil and gas. The OCI<sup>+ </sup>Preview web tool also converts emissions to another metric of emissions per megajoule of petroleum products. These conversions are calculated by multiplying default results by reported lower heating values (in megajoule per BOE of total processed oil, NGLs and gas). </p>
      <h3>Sorting Resources</h3>
      <p>The classification bounds used to sort resources in the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview are detailed in the table below. Crude oil types, natural gas types, and identified GHG emissions drivers incorporated into the web tool are as follows:</p>

      <p>Emission drivers are the operations where significant GHGs appear. These disaggregated results are then used to develop the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview web tool sliders (discussed below). Emission drivers include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Petcoke combustion </li>
          <li>Flaring </li>
          <li>Land use </li>
          <li>Steam </li>
          <li>Venting of associated gases</li>
          <li>Fugitives emissions of associated gases</li>
          <li>Pumping </li>
          <li>Renewable refinery hydrogen </li>
          <li>Refinery heat </li>
          <li>Upgrading </li>
          <li>End use</li>
          <li>Natural gas power</li>
          <li>Liquefaction</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>User-Defined Sliders</h3>
        <p>Emissions drivers are derived from operating decisions that can affect an oil’s and/or a gas’ GHG emissions. The web tool allows users to alter model parameters for steam production, gas liquefaction, flaring intensity, venting intensity, fugitives intensity, and renewable hydrogen, using sliders on the Supply Chain and View Details pages. Steam, gas liquefaction, flaring, venting, and fugitives sliders alter relevant OPGEE inputs, while steam and renewable hydrogen alter PRELIM inputs. The petcoke slider also alters OGPEM outputs. </p>
        <p>Note on the venting, flaring, and fugitives sliders: The venting, flaring, and fugitives sliders are not linked—for example, adjustments made to the venting slider do not affect the fugitive slider, and vice versa. This implies that a volume of gas handled at a field is not fixed. In this way, these sliders can be combined to represent a worst-case scenario, in which venting and fugitive emissions are additive.</p>
      <h3>Analysis Regression Lines</h3>
        <p>Regression lines presented on the Analysis page are calculated using the simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression method.</p>
      <h3>Methane Map</h3>
        <p>Unlike the flaring data and map, the methane map does not reflect the methane estimations used in the estimation of GHG emissions for the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview oils and gases. Methane emissions are estimated in OPGEE, with the exception of venting emissions, which are supplemented by IEA values, as described above. The methane map was obtained from analysis by Harvard professor and NASA affiliate Dr. Daniel Jacob, whose research is linked <a href="http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/">here</a>. Dr. Jacob and his team used global methane data collected 2010 to 2015 from the Japanese TANSO-GOSAT instrument in a global inverse <a href="https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/19/7859/2019/">analysis</a>. The image highlights methane hotspots around the world and is overlaid with OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview fields and GHG footprints. Dr. Jacob and his team are now analyzing new TROPOMI data that will be included in a future version of the OCI<sup>+</sup> web tool.</p>
      <h2 id="special-cases">Special Cases</h2>
      <h3>OPGEE Special Cases</h3>
        <h4>Modeling Multiple Zones</h4>
        <p>U.S. Texas Eagle Ford is modeled as four different fields in OPGEE 3.0 to account for the fact that the Eagle Ford formation contains different horizontal production zones that use different production practices to extract
            different volumes of different types of resource (e.g., black, volatile, condensate, and gas). These processes impact upstream emissions differently. The locations of each zone affect the calculation of flaring associated with each, since flaring
            values are calculated spatially in conjunction with NASA’s VIIRS satellite instrument whose data is then analyzed by NOAA. </p>
        <h4>CO<sub>2</sub> EOR</h4>
        <p>U.S. Wyoming LaBarge is a gas field known for its extremely high CO<sub>2</sub> content (66%), which is used for CO<sub>2</sub>-EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) at the nearby Salt Creek oil field. Some CO<sub>2</sub>-EOR operations qualify for a GHG
            emissions credit because they capture carbon dioxide from industrial exhaust. Wyoming LaBarge does not qualify, however, because its carbon dioxide is pulled out of an underground source in which it had already been naturally stored. For this
            reason, a U.S. Wyoming field is used in the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview web tool as a <em>Natural CO<sub>2</sub> EOR Example</em><strong><em>. </em></strong>Meanwhile, CO<sub>2</sub> capture for EOR purposes are being <a
              href="https://www.hartenergy.com/exclusives/adnoc-harnesses-co2-increase-oil-recovery-30742">adopted</a> by oil companies in the Middle East and North Africa. For this reason, a United Arab Emirates field is used as a <em>Manmade CO<sub>2</sub>
                EOR Example</em><strong> </strong>that uses CO<sub>2</sub> that is sequestered from manmade sources. A complete database compiled by the IEA for enhanced oil recovery projects is available <a
              href="https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2018/november/whatever-happened-to-enhanced-oil-recovery.html">here</a>. </p>
        <h4>Upgraded Synthetic Crude Oils</h4>
        <p>Canada Athabasca DC SCO is an unconventional oil sands resource, one of several that was modeled in the OCI that has been retained in the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview. Oil sands and extra-heavy oil production practices differ widely. (An infographic
            describing these techniques can be found <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/08/16/158907708/infographic-how-tar-sands-oil-is-produced">here</a>.) This oil is upgraded to a synthetic crude oil (SCO) before being shipped to a refinery. As such, its
            petcoke is produced upstream and added to the total estimated transport and combustion emissions in the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview. Additional oil sands and extra-heavy oils are planned to be included and updated in the OCI<sup>+</sup> web tool in
            the future. Note that the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview classifies this oil as “Extra-Heavy” and plots it based on its original gravity (as raw bitumen) of 8.5 degrees rather than referring to its re-engineered gravity (33 degrees).</p>

      <h3>PRELIM Special Cases</h3>
      <h4>Proxy Assays</h4>
      <p>When assays are not available, the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview uses proxy assays, which are deemed to have similar qualities as the crude oil or oil in the gas field. In the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview, the following proxy assays were used:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Natural and Manmade CO<sub>2</sub> EOR Example cases are run with Equinor’s Angola Girassol assay. </li>
          <li>Nigeria Obagi is modeled using Chevron’s Nigeria Bonny Light assay as a proxy. The crudes ultimately extracted are similar, though the two fields vary widely in their production processes. </li>
          <li>U.S. California Midway Sunset is modeled using Stratiev’s Venezuela Tia Juana assay as a proxy. The Midway Sunset oil field contains very complex oil. The API gravity is highly variable, ranging from the teens to the low twenties. The 1978
              oil assay obtained for OCI Phase 1 indicates a gravity of 22.6, while more recent studies have found a gravity of 12.6 degrees. The Tia Juana assay was chosen as a proxy because it is closer in API gravity, sulfur content, and product yields
              to the current Midway Sunset crude than the original Midway Sunset assay. Note that Midway Sunset crude is priced and tracked monthly as a 13 degree API gravity crude.</li>
          <li>U.S. Texas Eagle Ford oil and gas fields are modeled separately due to the wide range of characteristics (for example, API gravity), as well as production and refining practices, particular to each zone of oil and gas production in the Eagle
              Ford play. The U.S. Eagle Ford Condensate and Volatile Oil PRELIM cases, as well as the U.S. Eagle Ford Gas associated liquids, were run using Equinor’s Eagle Ford Chem Grade assay. The U.S. Eagle Ford Black Oil PRELIM case was run using
              Platts’s Eagle Ford Ultralight assay.</li>
          <li>A proxy crude was selected to model the oil associated with each gas field. For example, a condensate assay was selected to model the oil associated with Argentina Vaca Muerta’s gas production. Details on the proxy assay, if it applies, are
              listed in the Oil Details page for each oil or gas in the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview.</li>
      <h2 id="change-log">Change Log</h2>
      <p>As new, open access data is provided by others or uncovered through research, we update the OCI models and revise the estimates for life-cycle GHG emissions. This date-stamped log details changes since the OCI was released in March 2015.</p>

              <p>Five oils (Norway Skarv, Denmark Tyra, Norway Oseberg, Eagle Ford Condensate Zone and Nigeria Bonny) were removed from the 75 sample oils due to a shift in production at these sites that renders them producing predominantly gas. Norway Draugen oil added to replace Norway Skarv. Total number of sample oils in OCI 2.5 is 72 and the production sample size is 22.5 million barrels per day. This represents an estimated 28 percent of the 80.6 million barrels per day crude oil produced (not including NGLs and biofuels).</p>
              <p>2017 methane data reported by IEA was used as an interim estimate for methane emissions from venting and fugitives.</p>
              <p>A new map showing global methane emissions is added to the OCI<sup>+</sup> Preview web tool. The methane map is a product of Harvard professor and NASA affiliate Dr. Daniel Jacob and Dr. Bram Maasakkers. Methane is mapped using a five-year average of TANSO-GOSAT satellite data and a reverse chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem).</p>
              <p>LPG slider is removed.</p>
              <p>Flaring web tool map is updated with 2017 NOAA VIIRS satellite data.</p>

              <p>Nigeria Pennington was removed due to a significant decline in production as the field was depleted. It has been replaced with Nigeria Akpo, another sweet oil produced offshore.</p>
              <p>Wyoming WC was removed and replaced with Wyoming Silo as the current source of Wyoming Sweet oil. WC stands for “wildcat” wells, which are exploration wells drilled outside the confines of an oil field.</p>
              <p>Louisiana Lake Washington was removed because the Louisiana Light Sweet oil blend now includes oils from Texas and possibly oils imported through Texas terminals. </p>
              <p>Algeria Hassi R’Mel is now being modeled as a gas field instead of an oil field. While Hassi R’Mel does produce condensate, it is primarily a gas field.  </p>
              <p>Two new oils have been added. Congo N’Kossa is a sweet, ultra-light oil produced offshore. Ghana Jubilee is a sweet, light oil that is also produced offshore. </p>
              <p>Changed name of Bombay High crude oil to Mumbai High.</p>
              <p>Petcoke reference update: In order to improve outputs for petcoke emissions calculations, production tables for the Alberta Energy Regulator and Syncrude Canada were updated from 2014 to 2015 values provided by the Alberta Energy Regulator. For Suncor Energy, see table 1.3.1 and for Syncrude Canada, see table 1.3.2 on the “Petcoke Calculations” tab of the OCI workbook.</p>

                <p>Summary of changes since OCI <a href="http://oci1.carnegieendowment.org" target="_blank">Phase 1</a> made prior to release of OCI Phase 2</p>
                <p>Increased from 30 test oils to 75 sample oils, representing approximately 25 percent of current global production.</p>
                <p>Petcoke reference update: In order to improve outputs for petcoke emissions calculations, production tables for the Alberta Energy Regulator and Syncrude Canada were updated from 2013 to 2014 values provided by the Alberta Energy Regulator. For Suncor Energy (see table 1.1) and Syncrude Canada (see table 1.2) production numbers in the "Petcoke Details" tab integrated in the OCI workbook were updated from 2013 figures provided by the Alberta Energy Regulator to 2014–2015 figures.</p>
                <p>All OPGEE cases were rerun during Phase 2 with the updated OPGEE model version 1.1 draft E, which can be accessed <a href="https://pangea.stanford.edu/researchgroups/eao/research/opgee-oil-production-greenhouse-gas-emissions-estimator" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <p>Norway Ekofisk PRELIM assay was changed from a BP-provided crude assay to a Statoil-provided crude assay. This change better reflects the production by <a href="http://www.conocophillips.no/EN/our-norway-operations/greater-ekofisk-area/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">the current plurality producer within this field</a>.</p>
                <p>Canada Midale field was removed from Phase 2. This change reflects the fact that the Midale field's spatial boundaries, needed to calculate average flare rates, were penetrated by production associated with other oil formations.</p>
                <p>UK Brent field was removed from Phase 2. This change reflects the fact that the Brent field is now primarily a gas field, and its oil-production values are so low they distort OPGEE results, particularly for the flaring-to-oil ratio.</p>
                <p>All Phase 2 model inputs (OPGEE, PRELIM, and OPEM) were run with new global warming potentials reflecting one-hundred-year cycles that include climate-feedback loops. This data was obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2013 assessment report. Figures are located in Chapter 8, table 8.7, page 417, or <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. During <a href="http://oci1.carnegieendowment.org" target="_blank">Phase 1</a>, OPGEE and PRELIM used the IPCC's 2007 assessment report. According to the 2007 report, the reference gas, carbon dioxide, is assigned a GWP of 1, methane's GWP is 25 times greater than carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide is 298 times greater. The 2013 report updates methane's GWP to 34 times that of carbon dioxide.</p>
                <p>New products were added to PRELIM and OPEM: liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), asphalt, and petrochemical feedstocks. Only LPG is transported and combusted in OPEM, and like all other products, its emissions factor is taken from the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/documents/emission-factors_nov_2015.pdf" target="_blank">EPA</a>. PRELIM's functionality allows for a number of custom settings with respect to producing products. For example, users can specify the intensity of asphalt, gasoline, and diesel production—though the data reported in the OCI Phase 2 web tool illustrate only two cases: the default, where LPG is produced and sold by the refinery, and the secondary case, where LPG is burned as refinery fuel gas. Additionally, some products have changed names and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/documents/emission-factors_nov_2015.pdf" target="_blank">emissions factors</a>. Bunker C is now referred to as Residual Fuels in order to more accurately reflect the wide range of bottom-of-the-barrel residual co-products that are not necessarily all classified as bunker C. In Phase 2, in order to reflect product outputs as modeled in PRELIM, residual fuels' emissions factor is an average of Residual Fuel Oils No. 5 and No. 6. "Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel" has been renamed "Diesel."</p>
                <p>Changed names of oil sands:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Canada Light Sweet SCO to Canada Athabasca DC SCO</li>
                  <li>Canada Medium Sweet SCO to Canada Athabasca FC-HC SCO</li>
                  <li>Canada Cold Lake Dilbit to Canada Cold Lake CSS Dilbit</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These changes reflect more accurately the pathways used to extract and upgrade dilbit and synthetic crude oil, respectively.</p>
                <p>Venezuelan extra-heavy oils were classified similarly to Canadian oil sands, by pathway.</p>
                <p>Lower heating values (LHV) for petroleum products are sourced from GREET 1 2015 rather than extrapolating from EPA-reported higher heating values (as they had been in Phase 1) in order to remain consistent with the use of LHVs throughout the OCI.</p>
                <p>Sulfur is reported using PRELIM data rather than OPGEE data, as sulfur has a greater impact on emissions for PRELIM than OPGEE.</p>
                <p>Updated the emissions conversion section "Per $ Product Value" of the calculator to denote both the "Per $ Product Value (Historic)" for February 2015 prices as well as "Per $ Product Value (Current)" for April 2016 prices for those products that are priced monthly (see "OCI Input Data" above).</p>
                <p>Created data-quality measures (see "Data Quality and Transparency" above).</p>
                <p>Created a "Per $ Crude Oil" pricing calculator for globally priced crude oils, as well as domestic U.S.-priced crude oils, as sourced from the Oil and Gas Journal, which is published monthly. In Phase 2, we additionally chose to model the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per U.S. dollar value of a crude oil for those crudes whose prices are routinely tracked. Eighteen Phase 2 oils are currently priced and tracked. Two of our Phase 2 oils, UK Forties Blend and Norway Ekofisk, are priced according to the globally priced UK Brent basket of crudes because this basket is a blend of oils coming mostly from the Forties and Ekofisk fields. The "Per $ Crude Oil" pricing calculator will include prices from April 2016 as well as the historic prices from OCI <a href="http://oci1.carnegieendowment.org" target="_blank">Phase 1</a>, February 2015.</p>
                <p>Created the new section "Carbon Tax: $ per Metric Ton CO<sub>2</sub>," which can calculate the tax per barrel of oil for each of the OCI sample fields and break down the cost of a carbon tax for each stage of an oil's life cycle.</p>
                <p>Removed sliders for production of petrochemical feedstock and asphalt that were originally intended to be included in OCI Phase 2. They were slowing the speed of the web tool. These results from PRELIM version 1.1 can be found in the model itself, and we plan to include these additional co-products in Phase 3.</p>

                  <li>Canada Suncor Synthetic H to Canada Heavy Sour SCO (removed from OCI Phase 2 since this blend is an unusual oil sand pathway with a very small production volume)</li>
                  <li>Canada Suncor Synthetic A to Canada Light Sweet SCO</li>
                  <li>Canada Syncrude Synthetic to Canada Medium Sweet SCO</li>
                  <li>Canada Cold Lake Diluted Bitumen (Dilbit) was changed to shorten the length of the unique name in order to provide a better viewing experience for mobile devices. The other oils were changed to avoid using company names, which might imply that we are modelling their current specific pathway. While we have some company-specific data, such as assays, the pathways represented by the tool do not exactly represent company-specific operations and pathways. For example, upstream data is tied to the field (in this case, Athabasca) not the company, and transport distance is not tied to exact flows of crudes.</li>
