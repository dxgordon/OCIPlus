          <p><a href="https://watson.brown.edu/people/fellows/gordon" target="_blank">Deborah Gordon</a> is a Senior Fellow at the Watson Institute for International Affairs at Brown University. She formerly served as director of and a senior associate in the Energy and Climate Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Her research focuses on the climate implications of unconventional oil and fossil fuels in the United States and around the world. Gordon founded the transportation program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, taught at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, and developed vehicle efficiency policies at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. She began her career as a chemical engineer with Chevron and received a master’s degree in public policy from the University of California, Berkeley. From 1996 to 2010, Gordon ran a consulting practice specializing in transportation, energy, and environmental policy. She has served on National Academy of Sciences committees and the Transportation Research Board’s Energy Committee. Gordon has authored and contributed chapters to numerous books, including <em>Two Billion Cars </em>(with Daniel Sperling), which provides a road map for navigating the biggest global environmental challenges of this century—cars and oil (Oxford University Press, 2009). Her third book, <em>No Standard Oil </em>(Oxford University Press), about new climate strategies for abundant, heterogeneous oil and gas resources in a warming world, is forthcoming.</p>

          <p><a href="http://pangea.stanford.edu/~abrandt/" target="_blank">Adam Brandt</a> is an associate professor in the Department of Energy Resources Engineering at Stanford University. His research focuses on reducing the greenhouse gas impacts of energy production and consumption, with a focus on fossil energy systems. His research interests include life-cycle assessments of petroleum production and natural gas extraction. A particular interest of his is in unconventional fossil fuel resources such as oil sands, oil shale, and hydraulically fractured oil and gas resources. He also researches computational optimization of emissions mitigation technologies, such as carbon dioxide capture systems. Brandt received his doctorate from the Energy and Resources Group at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

        <div class="bio">
          <p>Frances Reuland, a Carnegie Junior Fellow in the Technology and International Affairs Program, assisted with an interim version of the OCI, which focused on petroleum sector methane, as well as the expansion of the OCI to include gas, culminating in the OCI<sup>+</sup> preview. Reuland began work under Gordon through the tenure of Carnegie’s Energy and Climate Program, and she continues as a consultant to Gordon at the Watson Institute at Brown University. Reuland graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a bachelor's degree in environmental sciences and Spanish.</p>
