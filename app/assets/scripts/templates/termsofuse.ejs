        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      </div>
      <p><em>Updated as of June 5, 2019</em>
      <p>By using this website (the "Website"), the user ("You") has accepted these Terms of Use. The Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University (“Watson”) may update these Terms of Use at any time. All changes shall be effective immediately.</p>
      <p><strong>Statement of Purpose:</strong> The Oil Climate Index + Gas (OCI<sup>+</sup>), a collection of three open-source models, was developed as an integrated tool to systematically estimate the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions embodied in an entire barrel of oil and a gas. While OCI<sup>+ </sup>transparency allows users to delve into the models themselves, the Terms of Use of the OCI<sup>+ </sup>requires that its underlying models are used together. This ensures that the OCI<sup>+ </sup>provides a fully comparable and comprehensive estimate of the lifecycle GHG emissions per barrel of global oils. The OCI<sup>+ </sup>is a web tool that is updated to include additional test oils as new, verifiable oil input data are collected. Refer to the OCI<sup>+ </sup>Change Log on the OCI<sup>+ </sup>Methodology tab for OCI<sup>+ </sup>updates. Exceptions for OCI<sup>+ </sup>model runs for atypical oils are referenced the Special Cases tab.</p>
      <p><strong>Attribution:</strong> When referencing official outputs from the Oil Climate Index + Gas (OCI<sup>+</sup>), subject to the Terms of Use above, cite the URL, <a href="https://www.oilclimateproject.com/">https://www.oilclimateproject.com/</a> </p>
      <p>If users input different assumptions into the OCI and report their own results, they should specify what they changed and cite the OCI as follows: “User’s modifications to <a href="https://www.oilclimateproject.com/">https://www.oilclimateproject.com/</a>.”</p><p><strong>Reporting Errors:</strong> To report data and calculations that the user believes to be in error, contact <a href="mailto:deborah_gordon1@brown.edu">deborah_gordon1@brown.edu</a>.  </p>
