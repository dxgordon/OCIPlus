## Development environment
To set up the development environment for this website, you'll need to install the following on your system:

- [Node and npm](http://nodejs.org/)
- Gulp ( $ npm install -g gulp)

After these basic requirements are met, run the following commands in the website's folder:
```
$ npm install

```

### Commands

Spins up a webserver to serve the website.
```
$ npm run serve
```

Compile the sass files and javascript.
```
$ npm run build
```

Lint the javascript files
```
npm run lint
```

Run all tests (and run the lint command above)
```
npm test
```

### Deployment
Running `npm run build` will build the site and put all the assets into a `dist` directory. That directory can be served statically from any server. The site is currently set-up to automatically deploy via [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and runs all tests before pushing a new version of the site live.
